1. The formula for Converting km to m & Examples:

As it is clear from the above equation, 1 km is equal to 1000 m. Therefore, the formula for 1 km to m will be-

Meter = value of km x 1000 m



2.The Formula for Converting From Kilometers to Centimeters
Km to m conversion is quite simple. The trick is to remember the 1 km to cm value, and you are good to go. 

The formula for Converting from Kilometers to Centimeters is:

Km = km*100000

3.Celsius To Fahrenheit Formula

Use this formula to convert a temperature in Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F).

Fahrenheit (°F) = (Celsius x 1.8) + 32
